**Is a simple kick, ban, or timeout not enough for you?**

**Do you ever wonder why the 8th amendment was ever set in place?**

**Do you just hate other people?**

If any of these apply to you, and you also happen to run a Minecraft server in which you have complete totalitarian power, this plugin is for you!

## Features:
- **27 different and unique Punishments that break the 8th Amendment** _(Each punishment does something that is strange or cruel to any player of your choice, an example being the WaterTank Punishment, which traps your victim in an obsidian tank full of water and give them mining fatigue so they drown)_
- **An innovative GUI system for striking down victims**
- **A quick punish command that can open the GUI, or run a specific punishment on a specific person**

![The Punishment GUI, accessible with /punish](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/c9f366607f80456204cbfa26b582bb940b302738.png)

Each punishment has a description in-game that tells you what they do

In order to use the /punish command, you must have the ```cruelandunusualpunishments.command.punish``` permission

## Compatibility:
- Paper ONLY
- Spigot and Bukkit both don't work
- 1.21.8 only, for now

### This plugin was made using [IF (Inventory Framework)](https://github.com/stefvanschie/IF/) for GUIs
